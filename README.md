## Introduction

Lost & Found HQ is a platform that helps businesses streamline their lost and found operations, making reuniting customers with their missing items effortless.

## Why

After losing my wallet, I thought it might be great if the process was a little more transparent. It would be great if instead of hoping staff saved a phone number and passed it on to other coworkers, perpetually keeping an eye out for a lost item, that I could visit a business' lost and found page and see if my item popped up at some point.

## Roadmap

- Log into your dashboard to manage lost and found items at your place of business. [#12](https://github.com/internetdrew/lost-and-found-hq/pull/12)
- Add your business location to your dashboard. [#15](https://github.com/internetdrew/lost-and-found-hq/pull/15)
- Users should be able to toggle public viewability on items, as well as edit and delete them. [#21](https://github.com/internetdrew/lost-and-found-hq/pull/21)
- Add testing to the frontend code. [#22](https://github.com/internetdrew/lost-and-found-hq/pull/22)
- Visitors can sign up to get launch updates. [#23](https://github.com/internetdrew/lost-and-found-hq/pull/23)
- Make test account available for visitors to play with and clear test user items. [#23](https://github.com/internetdrew/lost-and-found-hq/pull/23), [#24](https://github.com/internetdrew/lost-and-found-hq/pull/24)
- Allow users to create a public portal for customers to view items.
- Limit input lengths on dashboard.
- Add input validation to API layer.
- Integrate Stripe checkout for subscription
- Allow users to add a custom page slug once they're subscribed.
- Allow users to include a company logo for the public page view.
- Allow claims to be opened on the items publicly viewable.
- Add notifications to dashboard when new claims are opened.
- **Contemplation**: Should V1 allow users to takeover via email or should I build a full chat interface?
- When a claim is approved, the system generates a unique code for the customer to use at pickup.
- Add option for completing claim and marking an item as returned.

## Extended Roadmap

We only go here if the product takes off.

- Companies can view analytics on lost item trends and return rates.
- API access for companies to integrate the system with their existing customer service platforms.
- Multi-location support
- Inter-company item transfer for multi-tenant buildings or shopping centers
